Zero Trust deployment and enterprise-wide risk management

Advanced Red-Blue-Gold team exercises

Executive dashboards for KPIs, MTTR, MTTD, and risk prioritization

## Project Format

Each project contains:

Objective: The goal and skill being developed.

Tools / Commands Used: Terminal commands, scripts, SIEM queries, or lab setup.

Findings: Key observations and results from the exercise.

Analysis & Impact: Insights, security implications, and how it translates to SOC operations.

Evidence / Output: Screenshots, captured logs, or scripts to demonstrate results.

This format ensures each project demonstrates both technical capability and critical thinking, making the portfolio suitable for senior SOC analyst, SOC architect, or security operations leadership roles.

## Portfolio Highlights

Red-Blue-Gold Team Exercises: Large-scale enterprise attack detection and response simulations.

SOC Automation & AI Integration: SOAR playbooks, ML anomaly detection, predictive modeling.

Threat Intelligence Integration: TI feeds correlated with SIEM and endpoint monitoring for proactive defense.

Cross-Platform Threat Hunting: Windows, Linux, and macOS analysis in hybrid environments.

Enterprise Incident Response: Multi-stage ransomware, insider threat, and APT investigation.

Zero Trust & Enterprise Security Design: Micro-segmentation, MFA, continuous identity verification.

Executive Dashboards: KPI monitoring for MTTR, MTTD, threat trends, and asset risk prioritization.
